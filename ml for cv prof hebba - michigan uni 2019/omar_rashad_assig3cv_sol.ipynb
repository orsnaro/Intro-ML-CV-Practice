    "\n",
    "##### _1)_**What is the purpose of gradient descent optimization in machine learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**ans:** Used to find the best set of parameters for a model to minimize the loss function and perform well on a given task. It is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly adjusts the parameters in the direction that reduces the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _2)_ **What is the learning rate in gradient descent, and why is it important?**\n",
    "**ans**: It's important becuase it's the parameter that tells us How far should we go along the direction that loss function has steepest rate of increase. It's also called  `step size`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "#### _3)_ **What is the role of batch size in gradient descent optimization?**\n",
    "**ans**: \n",
    "It desides the number of training examples that are used to calculate the gradient of the loss function in each iteration. Determining batch size is important for these specific issues:\n",
